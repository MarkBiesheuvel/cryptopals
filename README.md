# The cryptopals crypto challenges

It's a bit late, but this is my attempt at solving the [cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)

To run all the challenges, use the following command:

```sh
py.test -v
```

To verify code styling, use this command:

```sh
pycodestyle
```

To verify the static typing:

```sh
mypy -p cryptopals -p tests
```
